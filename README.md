# Foggy Border

This Mod will replace the worldborder with Fog. Instead of weird blue lines you will feel the fog creepin in on you... Getting closer and closer as you try to leave the confinense of the world.
This Mod does not change how to worldborder behaves it just changes the way it is shown. 

## Shaders? 
So that is complicated. Some do work some do not. Just try it out :)

## Mods?
This mod works with Fog Looks Good Now. And should work with every Mod using correct Mixins.
